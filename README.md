1) Overall application
This application has been created to solve specific pain points that I have with recording my nutrition and fitness data on a daily basis, and then being asked to transcribe that into a specific Google Sheet template by my Personal Trainer (who's also my Brother-in-Law).

My PT wants me to track my weight on a daily basis, my macronutrient consumption on a daily basis, and the exact weights and reps lifted in my workouts. When these are plugged into the G-sheet, he can then use them to monitor whether I am sticking to my goals, the outputs of them, and there are also graphs to showcase trends over time. Ultimately, it's about tracking this data so we can observe if the input actions we are taking are having the desired effect, or if things need to change.

The problem is that _it takes so long to transpose this data_ into the template. What's even more frustrating is that I actually already have mobile apps to use to track my weight (Renpho, it automatically links to my scale with bluetooth to record my measurements) and food/macronutrient intake (MyFitnessPal, it contains a massive library of food produced by different suppliers and has the macronutrient data preloaded, so you just input what you've eaten and it knows exactly how many calories/protein/fat etc.). In practice, I'm defaulting to zero and not transposing this data due to the time involved - which means in practice I am missing out on the opportunity to action upon the meaningful information it provides.

For example, there were several weeks into my plan this year I wasn't actually dropping any weight and was unsure why. When I finally ran the data off the back of this app - it was apparent why, my calorie intake for those weeks Mon-Fri was within my targets, but I didn't record my food intake on those weekends. I realised in practice on those weekends when I decided not to track my food, I wound up consuming too much as a result and offsetting my calorie savings during the prior week.
